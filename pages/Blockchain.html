    In simple terms, blockchain is a decentralized distributed database, and each node in the distributed environment cannot be guaranteed to be trusted. The database stores blocks of data in chronological order, and each block holds several transaction records. Cryptographic methods are used to generate blocks to ensure that the data in them are tamper-proof, unfalsifiable, and verifiable; consensus algorithms are used to enable all nodes in the network (in theory, all nodes) to complete the recognition of the blocks.

  Blockchain is especially useful for developng health industry related products. In the current Electronic Health Record(EHR/EMR) Systems:
  <ol>
    <li>Medical information for a patient has multiple sources. Multiple pieces of such information need to be assembled together for effective healthcare decision making by the physician.</li>
    <li>Different hospitals have different systems of Electronic Health Records/Electronic Medical Records, there is no uniform and complete EHR system in the medical systems due to historical reasons.</li>
    <li>Different information sources have different authorization requirements that need to be satisfied before information can be release to someone else.</li>
    <li>No information can simply be broadcast or put on public access</li>
  </ol>
  Due to these existing problems in the medical care system, we could use the transparency and encryption nature of blockchain to help solve some of these problems.

    In this project, we explore a authorization smart contracts which is an adds-on to blockchain medical systems to provide patient-approved stratified medical information access for research use, for clinical use or kept private.
    Due to time constraints, we are not able to provide a holistic implementation of a whole blockchain Medical ecosystem, rather, we implement an authorization contract that could be added on existing systems to provide authorization rights to the patients, which utilizes the benefits of smart contracts and blockchain.

    Our project is valuable in the following ways:
    <ol>
      <li>Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. </li>
      <li>We use smart contracts to separate sensitive and non-sensitive data when patients log their medical information and we would show legal statements (HIPPA, EPHI) to notify the patients when they are authorizing their private data to a third party. The smart contracts would allow different levels of authorization of access to data. The smart contracts would also allow for protection of private data while delivering useful medical data the the health providers and doctors.</li>
      <li>We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain “miners”. By verifying transactions on the chain, they could get access to anonymized research medical data.</li>
      <li>Our product could also offer additional functions: helping patients see multiple doctors online and improving the efficiency for patients by resolving time/location/money/medical resources limitations through this online platform.</li>
      <li>Due to the lack of money, medical resources, and time, some patients do not have a chance to go to see a doctor in the hospitals. Our product is for the patients who might be in dire need of seeing doctors, or some of them who have difficult miscellaneous diseases. They want to get suggestions from multiple doctors within a short time.</li>
