    The current domain is mainly focused on the EHRs systems. Besides a decentralized EHR system on the Ethereum blockchain which reduces the cost of maintaining medical records at different EHR systems and preserving lifelong medical records for the patients, Our product could also offer additional functions: helping patients see multiple doctors online and improving the efficiency for patients by resolving time/location/money/medical resources limitations through this online platform.

    We, therefore, propose MedCoin Smart Contract: a novel, decentralized authorization smart contract to handle patient controlled authorization systems for EHRs, using smart contract technology. Our design gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Firstly, We use smart contracts to separate sensitive and non-sensitive data when patients log their medical information and we would show legal statements (HIPAA, EPHI) to notify the patients when they are authorizing their private data to a third party. Then, the smart contracts would allow different levels of authorization of access to data. The smart contracts would also allow for the protection of private data while delivering useful medical data to health providers and doctors.

    We would also implement inquiry/confirmation smart contracts for both parties during this part, we would alert patients of the possible use of private data and we would ask the doctors whether more private data is really needed.
