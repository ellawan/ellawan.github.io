  <p>As we are prototyping the blockchain applications on the Electronic Medical Records System using our proposed Medcoin application, we encountered several challenges. After careful evaluations and discussions, we decide to turn our project into an exploration of the pros and cons of using blockchain applications in the Electronic Health Records system.</p>
  <p>For our attempts, we used MetaMask to try to connect users to the test network, however, we find that it would be nearly impossible to authenticate the user’s identity and allow them to authorize, so we stop our implementation for the authorization here. </p>
  <p>We find that the proposed authorization contract could not meet the required authentication and testification functions of EHR, which are the two main requirements for EHR, we, therefore,  stop in our prototyping and in our conclusion provide a list of disadvantages of using Blockchain for EHR systems: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The cost of developing, maintaining, and upgrading a blockchain in healthcare is unknown.</li>
    <li>Blockchains can not go backward, and the data is immutable, which means it would be hard to modify false records.</li>
    <li>It’s hard to implement and manage the blockchain. Due to the supply and demand ratio, blockchain developers and specialists are harder to come by, and so will cost more than regular developers.</li>
    <li>It’s hard to authenticate the medical data and provide a unique id for each patient to match with the records in the existing EHR. Sharing medical data is a challenge.</li>
    <li>Insider privacy violations could be encouraged by easy access to medical records.</li>
  </ul>
