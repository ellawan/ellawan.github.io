    We create a decentralized smart contract application built on Ethereum using solidity programming and Remix. Our product would have a smart contract interface, allowing patients to authorize their medical data for necessary and legally justifiable use and enable patients to manage different levels of authorizations for access to their medical records. We also have an interface powered by smart contracts and Ethereum for the medical stakeholders (researchers, providers, doctors, etc.) to notify when their request for data has been accepted by the patients and allow them to offer medical advice and access to reward research data.

    This auditing layer of smart contracts has featured a security design that would prevent data breaches in the medical records and separate sensitive data from non-sensitive data: We separate sensitive and non-sensitive data when patients log their medical information and we would show legal statements (HIPAA, EPHI) to notify the patients when they are authorizing their private data to a third party. Then, the smart contracts would allow different levels of authorization of access to data. The smart contracts would also allow for the protection of private data while delivering useful medical data to health providers and doctors.

    This authorization contract would therefore provide the medical record requesters(doctors, researchers, providers) with stratified access to medical information for research use, clinical use, or kept private; Patients could choose different authorization levels for people to access their medical records enabling a distributed system that provides layered and use for info users and info providers. This authorization smart contract would be the core construct in our medical data encryption, authorization stratification, and medical records transfer aggregation pipeline.

    For the data acquisition, we plan to obtain medical data from the healthcare system that is authorized for school research use. We will transfer patientsâ€™ medical records from the healthcare system to our system. Since it would be hard for us to obtain the authentic data, and the data ingestion part would be easier to implement without the smart contract, we therefore assume that the data has been cleaned and fit within this smart contract in a readable format.

    By enabling decentralized storage of comprehensive, lifelong, authorized medical records for the patients, we could solve the incompatibility and enhance the interoperability of EHR. The patients could request their relevant medical records to be sent to various institutions according to their needs in a protected and made-easy way so that they no longer need to order and wait for fax when they transfer medical data between different EHR systems. Medical records could be protected from malicious distorted information and attack by the immutable and encrypted nature of blockchain technology. We could also effectively reduce the cost of medical records transfer and improve the encryption and authorization process of sensitive and non-sensitive medical data. Additionally, the smart contracts allow patients to access medical resources online so that they could get proper treatments whenever they needed and they do not have to be restricted by the location they are at and the limited time they may have. Easy access and affordable healthcare could be guaranteed in this way.
